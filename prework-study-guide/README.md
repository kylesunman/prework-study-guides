# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- My motivation for finishing this product was the fact that I'm creating a interactive webpage and its super interesting and enjoying doing things that make me problem solve!
- I built this project to dip my toes into the basics on seeing how every code language works together and how i can improve my skills as a novice coder
- Doing this project has helped me learn quite a bit about the basics of CSS, JAVA, and HTML and how they can work together to make a well designed webpage


## Usage

PTo use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
